    "Transformer block does not have memory to sequentially anaylize the data; however, it has position-dependent embedding, which is a kind of word embbeding that embed position of the input in the vector too. Furthermore, trnasformer block use self attation mechanisem to understand which part of the output is related to the input data. The core of transformer block is multi head attetion layer. In multi head atteation layer, three diffrent linear transformer, WQ,WK,and WV, applies to each word embbeding to tranform them to new  internal representation called Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V ). These states are then passed to the function that calculates the attention weights.[1],[2]\n",

    "Typically, a Quantum Neural Network module consists of three parts: encoder, ansatz, and measurement. We can create an encoder by passing a list of gates to tq.GeneralEncoder. Each entry in the list contains input_idx, func, and wires. Here, each qubit has a rotation-X gate. 8 RX gates in total. They can encode the 8 input data to the quantum state. Then we choose ansatz such that they are entangled between each other, rotated by an arbitrary angle. Finally, we perform Pauli-Z measurements on each qubit by creating a tq.MeasureAll module and passing tq.PauliZ to it. The measure function will return four expectation values from four qubits.\n"
